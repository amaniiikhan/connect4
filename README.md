# connect4
In making my connect 4 game,  I started out with the board, for which I created a dynamically allocated two-dimensional array of pointers(**gboard).This involved allocating space for an array of char pointers, and then allocating space for each pointer to point to an array of chars which would end up being the columns for each row. I then use the makeBoard function to create and print an empty labeled board. For each turn until a win or draw (draw determined by isFull function), my program gets user input from the player dictating which column they would like to add to, adds that input to a linked list using the listAdd function, adds the checker to the column and prints the updated board using the addChecker function, then updates a counter variable counting moves (indicating whose turn it is depending on an odd or even status), then checks if there is a win for the player who just conducted their turn using the isWin function. If there is a win (4 in a row) or the board is full and there is a draw, the loop breaks or ends. Then the moves are printed and the memory allocations for the board are freed.
